        "One of the great things about algebraic expressions is that you can write the same equation in multiple ways, or *forms*. The *slope-intercept form* is a specific way of writing a 2-variable linear equation so that the equation definition includes the slope and y-intercept. The generalised slope-intercept form looks like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "You can see intuitively that this is true. In our original form of the equation, to find y we multiply x by three, subtract 4, and divide by two - in other words, x is half of 3x - 4; which is 1.5x - 2. So these equations are equivalent, but the slope-intercept form has the advantages of being simpler, and including two key pieces of information we need to plot the line represented by the equation. We know the y-intecept that the line passes through (0, -2), and we know the slope of the line (for every x, we add 1.5 to y.\n",

Note that we don't specify a starting point for the vector - we're simply describing a destination coordinate that encapsulate the magnitide and direction of the vector. Think about it as the directions you need to follow to get to *there* from *here*, without specifying where *here* actually is!\n",

Most commonly, we thing about this dataset as a table that consists of a row for each observation, and a column for each individual data point related to that observation - we variously call these data points *attributes* or *features*, and they each describe a specific characteristic of the thing we're observing.\n",

        "### Types of Data\n",
        "Now, let's take a closer look at this data (you can click the left margin next to the dataset to toggle between full height and a scrollable pane). There are 933 observations, each one recording information pertaining to an individual child. The information recorded consists of the following features:\n",
        "- **family**: An identifier for the family to which the child belongs.\n",
        "- **father**: The height of the father.\n",
        "- ** mother**: The height of the mother.\n",
        "- **midparentHeight**: The mid-point between the father and mother's heights (calculated as *(father + 1.08 x mother) &div; 2*)\n",
        "- **children**: The total number of children in the family.\n",
        "- **childNum**: The number of the child to whom this observation pertains (Galton numbered the children in desending order of height, with male children listed before female children)\n",
        "- **gender**: The gender of the child to whom this observation pertains.\n",
        "- **childHeight**: The height of the child to whom this observation pertains.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that there are several distinct types of data recorded here. To begin with, there are some features that represent *qualities*, or characteristics of the child - for example, gender. Other feaures represent a *quantity* or measurement, such as the child's height. So broadly speaking, we can divide data into *qualitative* and *quantitative* data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Qualitative Data\n",
        "Let's take a look at qualitative data first. This type of data is categorical - it is used to categorize or identify the entity being observed. Sometimes you'll see features of this type described as *factors*. \n",
        "##### Nominal Data\n",
        "In his observations of children's height, Galton assigned an identifier to each family and he recorded the gender of each child. Note that even though the **family** identifier is a number, it is not a measurement or quantity. Family 002 it not \"greater\" than family 001, just as a **gender** value of \"male\" does not indicate a larger or smaller value than \"female\". These are simply named values for some characteristic of the child, and as such they're known as *nominal* data.\n",
        "##### Ordinal Data\n",
        "So what about the **childNum** feature? It's not a measurement or quantity - it's just a way to identify individual children within a family. However, the number assigned to each child has some additional meaning - the numbers are ordered. You can find similar data that is text-based; for example, data about training courses might include a \"level\" attribute that indicates the level of the course as \"basic:, \"intermediate\", or \"advanced\". This type of data, where the value is not itself a quantity or measurement, but it indicates some sort of inherent order or heirarchy, is known as *ordinal* data.\n",
        "#### Quantitative Data\n",
        "Now let's turn our attention to the features that indicate some kind of quantity or measurement.\n",
        "##### Discrete Data\n",
        "Galton's observations include the number of **children** in each family. This is a *discrete* quantative data value - it's something we *count* rather than *measure*. You can't, for example, have 2.33 children!\n",
        "##### Continuous Data\n",
        "The data set also includes height values for **father**, **mother**, **midparentHeight**, and **childHeight**. These are measurements along a scale, and as such they're described as *continuous* quantative data values that we *measure* rather than *count*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sample vs Population\n",
        "Galton's dataset includes 933 observations. It's safe to assume that this does not account for every person in the world, or even just the UK, in 1886 when the data was collected. In other words, Galton's data represents a *sample* of a larger *population*. It's worth pausing to think about this for a few seconds, because there are some implications for any conclusions we might draw from Galton's observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about how many times you see a claim such as \"one in four Americans enjoys watching football\". How do the people who make this claim know that this is a fact? Have they asked everyone in the the US about their football-watching habits? Well, that would be a bit impractical, so what usually happens is that a study is conducted on a subset of the population, and (assuming that this is a well-conducted study), that subset will be a representative sample of the population as a whole. If the survey was conducted at the stadium where the Superbowl is being played, then the results are likely to be skewed because of a bias in the study participants.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, we might look at Galton's data and assume that the heights of the people included in the study bears some relation to the heights of the general population in 1886; but if Galton specifically selected abnormally tall people for his study, then this assumption would be unfounded.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we deal with statistics, we usually work with a sample of the data rather than a full population. As you'll see later, this affects the way we use notation to indicate statistical measures; and in some cases we calculate statistics from a sample differently than from a full population to account for bias in the sample."

The range tells us very little about the comparative position of an individual value within the distribution - for example, Frederic scored 57 in his final grade at school; which is a pretty good score (it's more than all but one of his classmates); but this isn't immediately apparent from a score of 57 and range of 90.\n",

        "### Confidence Intervals\n",
        "A confidence interval is a range of values around a sample statistic within which we are confident that the true parameter lies. For example, our bag weight sampling distribution is based on samples of the weights of bags carried by passengers through our airport security line. We know that the mean weight (the *expected value* for the weight of a bag) in our sampling distribution is 3.2, and we assume this is also the population mean for all bags; but how confident can we be that the true mean weight of all carry-on bags is close to the value?\n",

        "Let's start to put some precision onto these terms. We could state the question another way. What's the range of weights within which are confident that the mean weight of a carry-on bag will be 95% of the time? To calculate this, we need to determine the range of values within which the population mean weight is likely to be in 95% of samples. This is known as a *confidence interval*; and it's based on the Z-scores inherent in a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Confidence intervals are expressed as a sample statistic &plusmn; (*plus or minus*) a margin of error. To calculate the margin of error, you need to determine the confidence level you want to find (for example, 95%), and determine the Z score that marks the threshold above or below which the values that are *not* within the chosen interval reside. For example, to calculate a 95% confidence interval, you need the critical Z scores that exclude 5% of the values under the curve; with 2.5% of them being lower than the values in the confidence interval range, and 2.5% being higher. In a normal distribution, 95% of the area under the curve is between a Z score of &plusmn; 1.96. The following table shows the critical Z values for some other popular confidence interval ranges:\n",

Thanks to the central limit theorem, if we used an even bigger sample size, the confidence interval would become smaller as the amount of variance in the distribution is reduced. If the number of samples were infinite, the standard error would be 0 and the confidence interval would become a certain value that reflects the true mean weight for all carry-on bags:\n",
